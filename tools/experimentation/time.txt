Testing times for compilation to see
if my Wasm approach to compiling noir programs in golang was viable/worth 
continuing. the results seem pretty decent tbh.
I think the building of the virtual file system, and parsing logic eat some time up. 
Also, I know including the rust build step is unfair. 

Pure nargo
nargo compile > time.txt  5.20s user 0.75s system 96% cpu 6.187 total

Calling functions in rust + build step
cargo run  70.77s user 1.03s system 98% cpu 1:12.92 total


Calling go binary.
Utilizing Wasm

./main  22.97s user 2.49s system 98% cpu 25.896 total
